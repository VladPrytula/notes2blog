# Notes on Modern Recommendation Systems: A Personal Exploration

These notes represent my ongoing effort to distill, clarify, and rigorously organize the foundational concepts and advanced techniques that are foundational to modern recommendation systems. The structure and content herein are not intended as a finished textbook, but rather as a living document—a record of my entangled mental journey.

### Motivation and Scope

For me, the deep allure of recommendation systems lies at the intersection of human behavior, statistical learning, and high-performance computing. Yet, beneath their practical success lies a rich tapestry of mathematical ideas, from linear algebra and optimization theory to probability and functional analysis. My primary aim in these notes is to traverse this landscape methodically, drawing a clear, unbroken line from first principles to the sophisticated architectures deployed in practice today. 

###  Approach

In organizing these chapters, I have have tried to force myself to a step-by-step-no-skip approach, a structure I believe is essential for building a robust and lasting understanding of any complex subject:

1.  **Intuition First:** Each new topic begins with a clear articulation of the underlying problem—the *why*. Analogies and real-world scenarios are used to anchor abstract ideas in a tangible context. Intuition, however, is not a destination, but the starting point of our inquiry.

2.  **Rigor Without Compromise:** After establishing the conceptual framework, we must build upon it with unyielding formalisms. Intuition without rigor is transient; rigor without intuition is sterile. Therefore, formal definitions, theorems, and mathematical derivations are presented with meticulous attention to detail. Every term is defined before use, and derivations are carried out step-by-step, with no logical gaps.

3.  **Application Through Code:** Theory is ultimately brought to life through computation. Carefully constructed code examples, primarily in PyTorch, serve as the essential bridge between mathematical abstraction and its concrete realization. Each code block is not an appendix, but a core didactic tool—introduced, dissected, and explained to make this connection transparent.

### Chapter Overview: The Journey So Far

Our exploration is structured as a logical progression, with each chapter building upon the insights and limitations of the last.

*   **Chapter 1: Personalization in Practice—A Batched Learning Baseline**
    We begin by establishing a strong, yet flawed, foundation. We construct a realistic e-commerce simulation and use it to train a standard deep learning recommender based on the "Embedding + MLP" architecture. A critical analysis reveals the inherent weaknesses of this static, batched learning approach, namely its inability to adapt to new information or intelligently explore its environment. This provides the crucial motivation for moving toward online learning.

*   **Chapter 2: The Adaptive Recommender—Contextual Bandits in Action**
    Here, we address the static nature of our baseline by introducing the **explore-exploit dilemma**. We formalize and implement the **Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LinUCB)** algorithm, a classic contextual bandit approach. Through a head-to-head simulation, particularly one involving a "market shock," we demonstrate the profound superiority of online, adaptive learning in a non-stationary world. However, we also identify its architectural limitation: its use of *disjoint models* prevents it from generalizing across the action space.

*   **Chapter 3: Neural Contextual Bandits—Generalization Through Shared Representation**
    This chapter represents a necessary synthesis, combining the adaptive nature of bandits with the powerful representation learning of deep networks. We introduce the **NeuralUCB** algorithm, which uses a single, shared neural network to generalize across all items. A significant portion of this chapter is dedicated to a rigorous analysis of computational efficiency, dissecting the "K-Pass Problem" of naive gradient computation and developing a vastly more efficient, vectorized solution via the Jacobian matrix. This serves as a deep dive into the practical marriage of theory and high-performance computing.
