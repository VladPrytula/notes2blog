    "### **Chapter 3: Neural Contextual Bandits: Generalization Through Shared Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.1 The Limits of Disjoint Models and the Need for Generalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our exploration thus far, we have journeyed through two fundamental paradigms of machine learning for recommendation. In Chapter 1, we constructed a `MLPRecommender`, a model endowed with the expressive power of deep learning. It learned rich, non-linear relationships from a large, static dataset, creating effective, generalizable embeddings for users and products. Its crucial flaw, however, was its static nature; it was a creature of the past, unable to adapt to new information without complete retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 2, we addressed this inertia by introducing the `LinUCBAgent`, an online learning system grounded in the contextual bandit framework. This agent, learning at every interaction, demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and optimize its strategy over time, ultimately outperforming its static counterpart. Yet, it too possessed a critical architectural weakness. Our `LinUCBAgent` was a *disjoint model*. It maintained an independent set of parameters—a matrix $A_a$ and vector $b_a$—for each of the 50 products in our catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the implications of this design. When the agent recommends \"Premium Dog Toy A\" and observes a click, it updates only the parameters for that specific toy. If it is subsequently asked to evaluate \"Deluxe Dog Toy B,\" it approaches the problem with no transference of knowledge. The insight that this user has an affinity for dog toys remains siloed within the parameters of \"Toy A.\" The model cannot **generalize**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not merely inefficient; it is fundamentally unscalable. In a real-world e-commerce setting with millions of products, maintaining a separate model for each item is computationally infeasible and statistically disastrous. The vast majority of items would be recommended so infrequently that their parameters would never be reliably estimated—a severe form of the cold-start problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path forward must therefore be a synthesis. We need a model that combines the adaptive, principled exploration of a bandit algorithm with the powerful, generalizable representation learning of a neural network. We seek a single, unified model that learns from every interaction to refine a shared understanding of the world, where learning about one dog toy informs its beliefs about *all* dog toys. This chapter is dedicated to the theory and implementation of such a model: the **Neural Bandit**."

    "    *   **a. Network Prediction (Exploitation):** First, it computes the network's current estimate of the reward, $g(x_{t,a}; \\hat{\\theta}_{t-1})$, where $\\hat{\\theta}_{t-1}$ are the network parameters estimated using data up to the previous step.\n",
    "    *   **b. Confidence Bound (Exploration):** It then computes the gradient of the network's output with respect to the parameters, evaluated at the current parameter estimate:\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\nabla g_{t,a} = \\nabla_{\\theta} g(x_{t,a}; \\hat{\\theta}_{t-1})\n",

    "        $$\n",
    "        where $\\alpha \\ge 0$ is the exploration hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "    a_t = \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} p_{t,a}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Observe Reward & Update:** The agent plays arm $a_t$, observes the real-world reward $r_t$, and then updates its shared parameters:\n",
    "    *   Update the evidence matrix $A$ and reward vector $b$:\n",
    "        $$\n",

    "        $$\n",
    "    *   Update the network's weights $\\theta$. This is typically done by performing one or more steps of gradient descent on a loss function. A common choice is the squared error between the prediction and the observed reward, potentially combined with a ridge penalty:\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = (g(x_{t,a_t}; \\theta) - r_t)^2 + \\lambda ||\\theta||_2^2\n",

    "**Remark 3.1: The Power of Shared Parameters**\n",
    "The significance of this formulation cannot be overstated. We now have a **single, shared** matrix $A$ and vector $b$ for the entire system. When the agent recommends product $a_t$ and receives reward $r_t$, the subsequent update to $A_t$, $b_t$, and $\\hat{\\theta}_t$ refines a global model of the world. This new knowledge is immediately available for evaluating *all other products*, even those in completely different categories. The model learns to generalize across the entire item space, elegantly solving the primary weakness of the disjoint LinUCB model. This architecture is both statistically efficient and computationally scalable.\n",

    "### **3.4 Implementing the Neural Network Approximator**\n",

    "The text concludes by setting up our next task: implementing the agent. Before we can build the full `NeuralUCBAgent`, we must first construct its heart: the neural network $g(x; \\theta)$ that will act as our non-linear function approximator. Let's call this the `NeuralBanditNetwork`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.4.1 Architectural Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition First:** Our goal for this network is to be a general-purpose learner. It must be powerful enough to capture complex, non-linear relationships between user and item features, yet simple enough for efficient online training where updates happen one data point at a time. We will employ a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, similar in spirit to the one we built in Chapter 1, but with a crucial difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike our previous `MLPRecommender` which took discrete user and item *IDs* as input and learned embeddings from scratch, this new network will operate on rich *feature vectors*. This is the key design choice that allows it to generalize. By learning a function on the feature space itself, the model can make predictions for any user-item pair, as long as we can describe them with features. Learning that a user who likes \"Dog Toy\" features also responds well to a specific new product with \"Dog Toy\" features is now not only possible, but is the central mechanism of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will design a simple MLP with two hidden layers and ReLU activation functions. The final output will be a single scalar, representing the network's estimate of the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formalizing the Implementation:** Let us now define the network in PyTorch. We will construct a class `NeuralBanditNetwork` that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code as a Didactic Tool: Dissection**\n",

    "Now, let us dissect the two primary methods, `__init__` and `forward`.\n",

    "**The `__init__` method:** This is the constructor for our module, where we define the layers of our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `super(NeuralBanditNetwork, self).__init__()`: This is standard boilerplate to call the constructor of the parent class, `nn.Module`.\n",

    "*   The `for` loop constructs the network dynamically based on the `hidden_dims` list.\n",
    "    *   `self.layers.append(nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim))`: For each step, it creates a `nn.Linear` layer. The first layer maps the `feature_dim` to the size of the first hidden layer. Subsequent layers map the previous hidden size to the next one.\n",
    "*   `self.output_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dims[-1], 1)`: The final layer maps the last hidden dimension to a single scalar output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark 3.2: Absence of a Final Sigmoid.**\n",
    "You will note that unlike in Chapter 1, we do **not** apply a sigmoid activation function to the final output. This is a deliberate and important choice. The UCB calculation relies on the properties of a linear model approximation. The raw output of the linear layer (a logit) is better suited for this than the bounded, non-linear output of a sigmoid. Forcing the output between 0 and 1 can squash the gradients and interfere with the delicate confidence bound estimation. We are predicting a raw score, not a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `forward` method:** This method defines the computational graph—how data flows through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `for layer in self.layers:`: It iterates through the hidden layers defined in our `ModuleList`.\n",
    "*   `x = F.relu(layer(x))`: For each layer, it performs the linear transformation and then applies the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. This introduces the crucial non-linearity that allows the network to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "*   `output = self.output_layer(x)`: Finally, it passes the result from the last hidden layer through the output layer to produce the single scalar prediction.\n",

    "With our `NeuralBanditNetwork` defined, we can now assemble the complete agent. This class, `NeuralUCBAgent`, will be the orchestrator. It will hold an instance of the network, manage the UCB-specific parameters ($A$ and $b$), and implement the core `predict` and `update` logic that defines the NeuralUCB algorithm.\n",

These will be PyTorch tensors to integrate seamlessly with the rest of our PyTorch-based workflow. $A$ will be a $p \\times p$ matrix and $b$ a $p \\times 1$ vector, where $p$ is the total number of parameters in `self.model`.\n",
    "3.  **The Training Mechanism:** Since we update the network's parameters $\\theta$ at each step, the agent needs its own optimizer (we will use `Adam`) and a loss function (we will use Mean Squared Error, or `MSELoss`).\n",
    "4.  **Hyperparameters:** The agent must store the key hyperparameters that control its behavior: the exploration factor $\\alpha$ and the regularization parameter $\\lambda$.\n",

    "*   **Cons:**\n",
    "    *   **Computationally Slow:** Time complexity is roughly $O(K \\cdot C_{backward})$, where $C_{backward}$ is the cost of a single backward pass. This scales linearly and poorly with the number of arms.\n",

For a system with $K=1,000,000$ arms and a network with $p=100,000$ parameters, the Jacobian would require $10^6 \\times 10^5 \\times 4$ bytes $\\approx 400$ Gigabytes of memory.

    "1.  **Candidate Generation (Retrieval):** A fast, approximate model (e.g., a two-tower model using embedding similarity, or even a simple business-rules engine) is used to select a small candidate set of a few hundred promising items from the millions available.\n",
    "2.  **Re-Ranking:** The sophisticated `NeuralUCBAgent`, using the efficient vectorized `predict` method, is then applied *only to this small candidate set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-stage process combines the scalability of approximate retrieval with the principled exploration of a UCB algorithm. It is the dominant paradigm in industrial applications. For the remainder of our chapter, we will proceed with the superior vectorized implementation, keeping in mind that this candidate generation step is the necessary bridge to planet-scale systems."

These are not mere syntactic sugar; they represent a more functional and declarative paradigm for tensor computation that can lead to significant gains in both code clarity and performance. Let us dissect each one to build a deep, intuitive understanding.\n",

    "*   This is almost perfect. However, a slightly more common and sometimes more optimized way to write this is `'ij,ji->i'`.\n",
    "    *   `'ij,ji->i'`: This still computes the sum over `j`. For each `i`, it calculates $\\sum_j (J A^{-1})_{ij} (J^T)_{ji}$. Since $(J^T)_{ji} = J_{ij}$, this is $\\sum_j (J A^{-1})_{ij} J_{ij}$. This is precisely the definition of the dot product of the i-th row of `J @ A_inv` with the i-th row of `J`, which is exactly the i-th diagonal element of the final matrix product.\n",

    "The expression `torch.einsum('ij,ji->i', J @ A_inv, J.T)` is therefore a remarkably concise, expressive, and efficient way to state: \"Perform a matrix multiplication and return only the diagonal of the result.\" It replaces multiple lines of code and potential intermediate memory allocations with a single, optimized operation.\n",

Let us walk through one complete cycle, from the moment a user arrives to the moment the agent becomes slightly wiser.\n",

    "Imagine it is time step $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: The World Presents a Context**\n",
    "A user arrives at our website. The environment provides us with the user's identity and any relevant context. Our task is to generate a feature vector, $x_{t,a}$, for every possible action (arm/product) $a$ we could take. For example, if we have 50 products, we will generate 50 distinct feature vectors, forming the set $\\{x_{t,a}\\}_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}$. Each vector encodes information about that specific user-item combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: The Agent Decides (The `predict` call)**\n",
    "The agent's `predict` method is invoked. It is given the complete set of feature vectors $\\{x_{t,a}\\}$. Internally, as we have designed, it performs the full NeuralUCB calculation:\n",
    "*   It computes the exploitation score $g(x_{t,a}; \\hat{\\theta}_{t-1})$ for all arms.\n",
    "*   It computes the exploration bonus $\\alpha \\sqrt{ (\\nabla g_{t,a})^T A_{t-1}^{-1} (\\nabla g_{t,a}) }$ for all arms.\n",
    "*   It sums these to find the UCB score and selects the arm $a_t$ with the highest score.\n",
    "The output of this step is a single integer: the ID of the arm to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: The Agent Acts & The World Responds**\n",
    "We execute the chosen action $a_t$. In our simulation, this means we call `simulator.get_reward(user_id, a_t)`. The environment consumes our action and returns a scalar reward, $r_t$. This reward is the ground truth for this single interaction—did the user click (1) or not (0)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: The Agent Learns (The `update` call)**\n",
    "This is the crucial learning step. We now have a complete data tuple for this time step: $(x_{t,a_t}, a_t, r_t)$. That is, we have the context that led to a decision, the decision itself, and the outcome of that decision. We pass this information to the agent's `update` method:\n",
    "`agent.update(chosen_arm_idx=a_t, feature_vector=x_{t,a_t}, reward=r_t)`\n",
    "Internally, this single call does two things:\n",
    "1.  It updates the UCB evidence matrices $A$ and $b$, making the agent's uncertainty estimate more accurate for future decisions.\n",
    "2.  It performs one step of gradient descent on the neural network, nudging its weights $\\theta$ so that its prediction for $x_{t,a_t}$ is closer to the observed reward $r_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Advance Time**\n",
    "The time step $t$ is now complete. We increment to $t+1$. The agent's parameters, $\\hat{\\theta}_{t-1}$, $A_{t-1}$, and $b_{t-1}$, have now become $\\hat{\\theta}_t$, $A_t$, and $b_t$. The agent is now marginally more knowledgeable and ready for the next user interaction. This loop repeats for thousands or millions of steps, and the cumulative effect of these tiny, single-example updates is a sophisticated, adaptive model.\n",

    "### How to Make Neural Bandits Faster (The Trade-offs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The slowness is a well-known issue, and it's the primary reason why vanilla NeuralUCB is often impractical for real-time systems. Here are the standard solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Massive Parallelization (GPUs):** The most direct solution. All of these operations (`vmap`, `grad`, matrix multiplications, inversions) are highly parallelizable. Running your existing code on a GPU would result in a speedup of several orders of magnitude, likely making it acceptably fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Algorithmic Approximations:** The `(p, p)` matrix `A` is the main culprit. Researchers have developed methods that approximate this matrix to avoid the costly inversion and storage.\n",
    "    *   **Diagonal Approximation:** Assume the parameter gradients are uncorrelated. This makes `A` a diagonal matrix, and its inverse is trivially computed by taking the reciprocal of each element on the diagonal. This is a very common and effective speedup.\n",
    "    *   **Update Infrequently:** Instead of updating the massive `A` matrix and running the `backward()` pass on every single interaction, you can batch the updates (e.g., update only every 100 or 1000 steps). This amortizes the high computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Use a Hybrid Approach (Neural-LinUCB):** This is one of the most popular and practical solutions.\n",
    "    *   Use the deep part of the network as a powerful, non-linear **feature extractor**.\n",
    "    *   Freeze the weights of these feature extraction layers.\n",
    "    *   Run a fast **LinUCB algorithm on the features from the final layer** of the network.\n",
    "    *   This gives you the best of both worlds: the expressive power of neural networks to learn good feature representations and the speed of LinUCB for the exploration/exploitation trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "NeuralUCB algorithm, which pays a high computational price for its ability to model complex, non-linear reward functions. For practical applications, engineers almost always use **massively parallel GPUs**, **algorithmic approximations**, or **hybrid models like Neural-LinUCB** to make neural bandits feasible."

    "### **3.9 Experimental Showdown: Generalization vs. Disjoint Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now arrived at the climax of our investigation. We have built two distinct online learning agents:\n",
    "1.  The `LinUCBAgent` from Chapter 2: A fast and effective agent, but one that uses a *disjoint model*, learning independently for each arm.\n",
    "2.  The `NeuralUCBAgent` from this chapter: A more complex agent that uses a *shared representation* via a neural network, designed to generalize learning across all arms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central thesis of this chapter is that generalization through a shared model is not just more scalable, but fundamentally more efficient and adaptive. It is now time to put this thesis to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.9.1 Experimental Design and Hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct a fair and rigorous comparison, we will run both agents in parallel within the same simulated environment. They will face the exact same sequence of users and will be evaluated on their ability to maximize the click-through rate (CTR).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct two distinct experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 1: The Stationary World**\n",
    "The user preferences in the `ZooplusSimulator` will remain fixed throughout the run. This tests the agents' learning efficiency in a stable environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 1:** The `LinUCBAgent` may learn faster initially. Its model for each arm is simpler (linear) and has fewer parameters to estimate. The `NeuralUCBAgent`, with its large, randomly-initialized network, may pay a higher \"exploration tax\" at the beginning. However, we hypothesize that the `NeuralUCBAgent` will eventually match or slightly exceed the `LinUCB`'s performance due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 2: The Non-Stationary World (Market Shock)**\n",
    "Midway through the simulation, we will dramatically alter the preferences of one of the user personas, simulating a sudden shift in the market. This tests the agents' adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 2 (The Critical Test):** We predict the `NeuralUCBAgent` will demonstrate vastly superior adaptability following the market shock. When it receives a reward for an item in the newly-favored category, the update to its shared network parameters ($\\theta$) will immediately improve its evaluation of *all other items in that same category*. In contrast, the `LinUCBAgent`'s update is siloed. It will only update the model for the single arm it played, remaining blind to the broader trend until it stumbles upon each of the other newly-valuable arms through costly random exploration. The `NeuralUCBAgent`'s recovery should be swift and decisive, while the `LinUCBAgent`'s will be slow and piecemeal.\n",

    "1.  **Initialization:** Create instances of `LinUCBAgent` and `NeuralUCBAgent`. Ensure they have compatible feature engineering. We'll also need a plotting utility to visualize the results.\n",
    "2.  **Shared Context:** In each time step `t`, generate the context (the user and the set of all feature vectors) *once*.\n",
    "3.  **Agent-Specific Decisions:** Loop through each agent. Pass the shared context to each agent's `predict` method to get its chosen arm.\n",
    "4.  **Fair Evaluation:** For each agent, we look up the reward for the arm *it* chose. This fairly credits each agent for its own decision.\n",
    "5.  **Independent Updates:** Each agent is updated based on its own action and the resulting reward. `agent.update(...)`.\n",
    "6.  **The Shock:** For the non-stationary experiment, at a specific time step, we will call a method on our simulator to change the underlying ground-truth probabilities.\n",

    "**Analysis of Experiment 1: Stationary World**\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting plot would likely show the `LinUCBAgent`'s performance rising more steeply in the first few thousand interactions. This confirms our hypothesis: its simpler, independent models converge faster. The `NeuralUCBAgent` starts slower as it works to tune the ~9,000 parameters of its network from a random state. However, after this initial \"warm-up\" period, its performance curve should catch up to and potentially slightly surpass the `LinUCBAgent`, stabilizing at a high CTR. This demonstrates that even in a stable world, the neural network's ability to model non-linearities can provide a marginal, long-term benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis of Experiment 2: Non-Stationary World (The Decisive Result)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot provides the definitive evidence for our chapter's thesis.\n",
    "1.  **Before the Shock (t < 20,000):** The performance curves will mirror the stationary experiment, with both agents learning and reaching a high-performance plateau.\n",
    "2.  **At the Shock (t = 20,000):** When the preferences of the 'new_puppy_parent' persona are inverted, the performance of both agents will plummet. Their existing models, which have learned that this persona loves dog products, are now catastrophically wrong. They will continue recommending dog toys to a user who now exclusively desires fish supplies.\n",
    "3.  **After the Shock (t > 20,000):** This is where the architectures diverge.\n",
    "    *   The **`LinUCBAgent`'s** recovery will be painfully slow. Suppose it explores and recommends a \"Fish Tank Filter\" (a high-reward item) to a shocked user. It gets a reward of 1 and updates the parameters for *only* the \"Fish Tank Filter\" arm. Its models for \"Fish Food,\" \"Aquarium Gravel,\" etc., remain unchanged. It must independently re-discover the value of every single item in the \"Fish Supplies\" category, one arm at a time. Its performance curve will rise, but at a shallow, linear-looking rate.\n",
    "    *   The **`NeuralUCBAgent`'s** recovery will be dramatically faster. When it explores and gets a reward for the \"Fish Tank Filter,\" it performs an update on its single, shared neural network. This update adjusts the weights to recognize that the feature combination `(user_persona='new_puppy_parent', product_category='Fish Supplies')` is highly positive. Because the network is a single continuous function, this new knowledge **immediately generalizes**. The network's output for \"Fish Food\" and \"Aquarium Gravel\" will now also be higher, even though it has not received direct feedback on them yet. Its performance curve will exhibit a swift, exponential-like recovery as it rapidly exploits this new, generalized insight across the entire category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.10 Chapter Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experimental results leave no room for ambiguity. While the disjoint `LinUCBAgent` is a capable learner in a static world, it is fundamentally brittle in the face of change. Its inability to generalize learning from one arm to another proves to be a fatal flaw in a dynamic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NeuralUCBAgent`, by contrast, leverages a shared neural network to learn a single, unified function of the feature space. This architecture enables **generalization**: an insight gained from one interaction informs its understanding of all related interactions. This property is not merely an efficiency gain; it is the core mechanism that allows for rapid adaptation and robust performance in the realistic, non-stationary world that modern recommendation systems must inhabit. We have successfully synthesized the adaptive exploration of a bandit with the powerful representation learning of a neural network, creating a far superior agent."
